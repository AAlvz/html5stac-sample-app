# Quick Start

## What is HTML5stac?

HTML5stac is a cloud platform for easily building fast, scalable, responsive websites that work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. 
It was created to address the needs of modern HTML5 web applications, and features the following:

1.  JavaScript everywhere: both on the client & server-side
2.  RESTful APIs for all data objects
3.  Live API console & data inspector
4.  Device-aware templating built on [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

HTML5stac uses popular libraries like [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework, so it's easy to get started.

HTML5stac lets you focus on building full-featured websites rapidly using only JavaScript. Other developer-friendly features include separate staging & production environments, and push-button deployment.

To get started with HTML5stac, sign up at [http://developer.mobstac.com](http://developer.mobstac.com).

# Creating a Sandbox

This tutorial guides you through the steps needed to create a Sandbox environment with Mobstac. The tutorial assumes that you have already signed up with [Mobstac For Developers](http://developer.mobstac.com). Once you have the sandbox environment ready, you can make full use of the variety of features offered by HTML5stac.

## Fork Demo App

It's always helpful to start with an example to get familiar with a new framework. We have a demo app available for you to play with at <http://demo.mobstacapp.com>. To modify the Demo App, you can fork the repository at [GitHub](http://github.com/MobStac/HTML5StacDemo/).

## Deploy Fork to Server

To deploy your fork to Mobstac server, hit the Deploy button during Signup and it will get deployed. For future deployments, please refer to API Console Tutorial (coming soon).
